Question 2

Difference between arrays and linked list in terms of;

1.Memory allocation
Arrays - for arrays they use contiguous memory allocations that is the whole array is stored in a contiguous block of memory.

Linked list - they use dynamic memory allocation . Each node can be stored anywhere in the memory and each node contains a reference to the next node .

2. Performance

Arrays- For arrays accessing elements is easier and faster this is because you can directly access an index in constant time . However performing instructions such as deleting and inserting can be quite slow this is because of shifting the elements .

Linked list - In linked list accessing elements is quite slower ,this is because you have traverse the list from the head node to the element you want.

3.Insertion and Deletion operations
Arrays - performing the insertion and the deletion operation in arrays can be slow and inefficient.

Linked list - While performing these operations in the linked list is efficient.
